.. function:: patch_up_roi(roi)

   After being non-linearly transformed, ROIs tend to have holes in them.
   We perform a couple of computational geometry operations on the ROI to
   fix that up.


   :Parameters:

       **roi** : 3D binary array
           The ROI after it has been transformed.

       **sigma** : float
           The sigma for initial Gaussian smoothing.

       **truncate** : float
           The truncation for the Gaussian

   :Returns:

       ROI after dilation and hole-filling
