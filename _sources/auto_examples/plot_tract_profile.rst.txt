==========================
Plotting tract profiles
==========================

An example of tracking and segmenting two tracts, and plotting their tract
profiles for FA (calculated with DTI). This example uses the Yeatman et al.
waypoint ROI approach, first described in [Yeatman2012]_ and further elaborated
in [Yeatman2014]_.

Register the individual data to a template:
-------------------------------------------
For the purpose of bundle segmentation, the individual brain is registered
to the MNI T2 template. The waypoint ROIs used in segmentation are then each
brought into each subject's native space to test streamlines for whether they
fulfill the segmentation criteria.

.. note::
    Here, we calculate just a non-linear transformation between the
    individual's brain and the MNI T2 template. In practice, it's a good idea
    to also perform a pre-alignment using an affine transformation. We don't
    do that here, but this is part of the full pipeline implemented in the
    CLI.

Read in bundle specification
-------------------------------------------
The waypoint ROIs, in addition to bundle probability maps are stored in this
data structure. The templates are first resampled into the MNI space, before
they are brought into the subject's individual native space.
For speed, we only segment two bundles here.


.. code-block:: default


    bundles = api.make_bundle_dict(bundle_names=["CST", "ARC"],
                                   resample_to=MNI_T2_img)









Tracking
--------
Streamlines are generate using DTI and a deterministic tractography
algorithm. For speed, we seed only within the waypoint ROIs for each bundle.

Segmentation
--------
In this stage, streamlines are tested for several criteria: whether the
probability that they belong to a bundle is larger than a threshold (set to
0,per default), whether they pass through inclusion ROIs and whether they do
not pass through exclusion ROIs.

Cleaning
--------
Each fiber group is cleaned to exclude streamlines that are outliers in terms
of their trajector and/or length.


.. code-block:: default


    print("Cleaning fiber groups...")
    for bundle in bundles:
        print(f"Cleaning {bundle}")
        print(f"Before cleaning: {len(fiber_groups[bundle]['sl'])} streamlines")
        new_fibers, idx_in_bundle = seg.clean_bundle(
            fiber_groups[bundle]['sl'],
            return_idx=True)
        print(f"Afer cleaning: {len(new_fibers)} streamlines")

        idx_in_global = fiber_groups[bundle]['idx'][idx_in_bundle]
        np.save(f'{bundle}_idx.npy', idx_in_global)

Bundle profiles
---------------
Streamlines are represented in the original diffusion space (`Space.VOX`) and
scalar properties along the length of each bundle are queried from this
scalar data. Here, the contribution of each streamline is weighted according
to how representative this streamline is of the bundle overall.
